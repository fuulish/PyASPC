# PyASPC
Implementation of always-stable predictor corrector skeleton to be used for explicit propagation instead of iterative solution of self-consistent field equations.

# Install

    $ python setup.py install
    $ nosetests -v aspc

# Getting started

Create an instance of the ASPC class by providing initial data, predictor-chain length, and a corrector function.
The latter takes the predicted data as initial guess, performs one iteration, and then returns the final solution at this step.
This can then be used to, e.g., propagate equations of motion, which would yield the next step that can be fed into the ASPC instance.

For a basic example see tests/functionality.py or moody/tests.py
